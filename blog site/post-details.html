                        After spending my entire life in Tennessee, I can definitely say that there is a lot to offer here. 
                        I have now spent my entire four years of my college career right here in Knoxville, TN. 
                        You may often hear of the bad parts of Tennessee or even rough areas of Knoxville, but I can assure you

                        The historic Market Square neighborhood in Downtown Knoxville is a great place to visit on a day out.
                        With plenty of food and drink options, this makes the perfect place for lunch or dinner. 
                        There are also plenty of options for family and kids and even dog friendly. During the winter, there is a famous ice rink held there as well.
                        This location can be a bit busy at times, especially during the winter when the rink is out. Despite the potential heavy crowds,
                        it is still something you do not want to miss.

                        The Embassy Suites hotel located in Downtown Knoxville contains access to a rooftop bar
                        called the Radius Rooftop Lounge. This rooftop has access to an indoor lounging and bar area, which is perfect
                        for those who love drinks and want to get a cocktail. During the day, the pool and hot tub outside are open and can be used by guests.
                        After sunset, the lounge becomes adult only with a strict clothing policy though, so you may want to plan ahead for that. Even if you do not
                        want any drinks, the view you get to witness from that height is very much worth it.
